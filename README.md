# **Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering**
*A **Semester 1 MSc. Data Analytics** project at **Berlin School of Business & Innovation (BSBI)**, where I applied **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. This project directly aligns with my professional experience at **Sakon (GSG)**, where I optimized data workflows and reduced errors by **11%**, and my focus on **data-driven decision-making** in retail and customer analytics.*

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project analyzes an **online retail dataset** (from UCI Machine Learning Repository) to segment customers using **K-Means clustering**. The goal was to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing patterns (e.g., frequency, total spending, and quantity purchased) to enable **targeted marketing, personalized customer service, and resource allocation**. This mirrors my work at **Sakon (GSG)**, where I used data analytics to optimize customer insights and improve business strategies.

### **Key Achievements**
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure high-quality data—similar to my work at **Sakon**, where I reduced data errors by **11%**.
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generated visualizations (e.g., monthly sales trends, popular products) to uncover patterns—aligning with my **Power BI dashboard** experience.
✅ **K-Means Clustering**: Segmented customers into **2 optimal clusters** using the **silhouette score**, achieving clear separation for targeted strategies.
✅ **Business Insights**: Identified high-value customers and seasonal trends, directly applicable to **retail and marketing strategies**.
